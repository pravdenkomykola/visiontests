  <h2>QUESTION & ANSWER</h2>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <p class="q">What is the Tumbling E eye chart test?</p>
    <p class="a">A tumbling E chart is a vision chart that only uses E’s. As with a ‘standard’ eye chart, 
      they get smaller as they go down the chart but they also rotate direction.tumbling E chart is used to measure visual acuity, especially when a person cannot read letters, 
      such as young children or individuals who speak different languages.</p>

    <p class="q">Understanding Your Vision Test Results, How to Read Your Score</p>
    <p class="a">This vision chart uses a 2/10 scale format, which works at arm’s length (approximately 2 feet) instead of the traditional 20-foot distance used in eye doctor offices.The format is: Your Distance / Normal Vision Distance
<br>For example:<br>
1)2/10 means you must stand 2 feet away to see what a person with normal vision can see from 10 feet away<br>
2)2/2 means you see at 2 feet what a person with normal vision sees at 2 feet<br>
3)2/1.5 means you see at 2 feet what a person with normal vision would need to move closer (to 1.5 feet) to see<br>
    Your vision quality categories look reasonable:<br>
2/1.5 = Perfect/excellent (20/15 equivalent)<br>
2/2 = Good/normal (20/20 equivalent)<br>
2/3 = Acceptable (20/30 equivalent)<br>
2/4 to 2/6 = Poor (20/40 to 20/60)<br>
2/8 to 2/10 = Very poor (20/80 to 20/100)</p>

    <p class="q">What is Miopia?</p>
    <p class="a">Nearsightedness (myopia) is when close-up objects look clear but distant objects are blurry. For instance, you can read a map clearly but have trouble seeing well enough to drive a car. Nearsightedness is a common eye focusing disorder. 
      It has been on the rise for several decades. It is estimated that by 2050, nearly half the people in the world will have nearsightedness.</p>

    <p class="q">What Is Hyperopia?</p>
    <p class="a">Farsightedness, also called hyperopia, is a refractive error. This is when the eye does not refract—or bend—light properly. A farsighted person may not notice any problems with their vision, especially when they are young.Symptoms of farsightedness is a difficulty with close tasks like reading, eye crossing in young children, squinting.
A person's age and severity of their farsightedness impacts how it affects their vision. Near vision is blurry while distance vision is generally clearer.</p>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <p class="q">What is an astigmatism?</p>
    <p class="a">To understand astigmatism, it is helpful to think of the normal eye as evenly rounded, like a basketball. With astigmatism, the eye is egg- or oval-shaped like a North American football.
      <br>There are two basic types of astigmatism:<br>horizontal astigmatism (an eye wider than it is tall)<br>vertical astigmatism (an eye taller than it is wide)
      <br>With either type of astigmatism, near and far vision is blurry because of the eye’s irregular shape.</p>
